1) Delete based on timestamp (works only for tables with a timestamp column)

DELETE FROM [table name] WHERE timestamp >= '[Date] [Time]';
Example:
DELETE FROM IncidentReport WHERE timestamp >= '2024-11-01 10:56:14';

2) Delete the most recent entries

 -- Delete the last 5 rows in GPSLog
DELETE FROM GPSLog ORDER BY log_id DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Delete the last 5 rows in IncidentReport
DELETE FROM IncidentReport ORDER BY report_id DESC LIMIT 5;


3) Delete based on user id (don't use this method)

-- Delete entries for a specific user_id in GPSLog and IncidentReport
DELETE FROM GPSLog WHERE user_id = 1;  -- Replace with the actual user_id
DELETE FROM IncidentReport WHERE user_id = 1;
